For example, a borrower was unaware that their auto-debit payments had been suspended during the COVID-19 forbearance period, leading to missed payments.\\n\\n2. **Errors and Delays in Servicing and Reporting:** Many complaints involved errors such as incorrect account statuses, reports of delinquency without proper notification, or misapplication of payments. For instance, some borrowers were wrongly reported as delinquent or 90 days late, which impacted their credit scores.\\n\\n3. **Systemic Failures and Systemic Deception:** There are systemic issues like servicers steering borrowers into forbearances instead of income-driven repayment plans, or not informing them of options that could reduce their balances or preserve forgiveness. Some borrowers were coerced into consolidating their loans under unfavorable terms, which increased their debt.\\n\\n4. **Interest Capitalization and High Costs:** Complaints highlight that interest continued to accrue and compound during forbearance or deferment periods, leading to ballooning balances, making repayment more difficult.\\n\\n5. **Difficulty in Accessing Customer Service and Resolution:** Many borrowers faced unhelpful or dismissive responses from servicers, delays in resolving issues, or were not provided with proper channels or guidance for managing their loans.\\n\\n6. **Unforeseen Events and Financial Hardships:** Some borrowers faced personal hardships such as unemployment, medical issues, homelessness, or unexpected life events, which severely impacted their ability to keep up with payments.\\n\\n7. **Technical and Administrative Failures:** Systematic failures like not notifying borrowers when their loans were transferred, or mistakes in reporting payments, contributed to default or delinquency issues.\\n\\nIn summary, the failure to pay back loans was often due to a combination of systemic servicing failures, lack of proper communication, and financial hardships, which were worsened by errors and deceptive practices in loan handling and reporting.'"

        "4. When we query our Retriever, we will do a similarity search comparing our query vector to the \"child chunks\".\n",

        "* Semantic chunking can sometimes produce unexpected results. One potential issue is under-chunking, where multiple distinct question-and-answer pairs are grouped into a single large chunk. This tends to happen when the semantic similarity between the end of one answer and the beginning of the next question is high, as they all relate to the same general topic. \n",

        "* On the other hand, over-chunking, or fragmentation, can also be problematic. This occurs when we attempt to separate text at points where topic changes happen, but in short, repetitive sets like FAQs, nearly every sentence may seem like a topic change. As a result, this can create tiny chunks, sometimes as small as one sentence, which can negatively impact retrieval because there is less context for the embeddings to work with. Additionally, if many chunks contain nearly identical sentences, it leads to wasted storage and computational resources on duplicate vectors.\n",

        "* It can be observed that the multi-query and ensemble retrievers excel in context recall, while the BM25 retriever achieved the highest context precision.\n",

        "* The ensemble retriever has the highest latency and cost compared to other options.\n",
